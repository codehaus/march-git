Subject: Recent Drools updates

In the last two months, several updates and improvements have been made 
to the Drools project.  All of the updates are available in the project CVS.

There is a new documentation site up in Confluence.  We're going to be 
porting all of the information from the Drools project page to the 
confluence docs. (http://docs.codehaus.org/display/DROOLS/Home).  Right 
now information about the new mailing lists, CVS and JIRA tasks for the 
beta-14 release have been collected there.

The JSR-94 compatibility layer is passing all of its unit tests, and 
soon we're going to start testing it against the TCK.  We should also be 
able to update the Miss Manners benchmark test.  I'm considering having 
two Miss Manners benchmarks--one which uses the JSR94 API, and one which 
does not.  We might also port the Miss Manners benchmark tests to the 
Groovy and Python semantics modules, so that we can compare their 
performance differences as well.

We have a working top-level maven build.  At the moment, it will run a 
multiproject:install on each of the project directories in turn.  Some 
have asked for a goal building out a drools-full JAR, which would 
package together the drools-core, drools-smf, drools-io and drools-base 
modules.  The semantics plugins and JSR94 module would need to be 
included.  I'll get to work on that as soon as I can.

At this time, we are very close to a beta-14 release.  The remaining 
tasks for the beta-14 release are in the JIRA table at the bottom of the 
Drools confluence page.

As we push for the beta-14 release, I hope to flesh out the project 
documentation and include much better DRL reference materials, and 
information about writing semantics plugins.

Thanks,

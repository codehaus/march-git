Subject: AW: AW: [m2eclipse-user] m2Eclipse plugin remains unusable without install support

Hi Eugene,

I have still problems with the latest version 0.0.12:
Workspace-Dependency-Resolution doesn't work and if I try to activate =
this
via context menu nothing changes... If I have a maven dependency to =
project
which is included in the current workspace it is left out completely =
from
maven dependencies and stops me compile this project under eclipse.

Since this is a show stopper I have to switch back to the working =
version
0.0.11 ...

Marc

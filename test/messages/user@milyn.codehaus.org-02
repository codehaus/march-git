Subject: Namespace issue

Hi,

I've been having some trouble with namespaces when using smooks for transforming xml to xml. The problem we had was that the input xml contained namespaces and there was an issue with this prior to version 0.9 of smooks.

But we were still having problems and this was because we were not using namespaces in our "Templatelet" configurations.

This is what we had:

<FirstName>
    <xsl:value-of select="./buyer/name"/>
</FirstName>

But we should have been using:
<FirstName>
    <xsl:value-of select="./xxx:buyer/xxx:name"
    xmlns:xxx="http://www.www.org.com/xxx/XXX" />
</FirstName>

Now, this is ok and works, but I suspect that there are better ways of doing this?

Does anyone know if it is possible to specify the namespace globally inside a Templatetet so that one does not have to specify this for every xsl element?

Thanks,

Daniel

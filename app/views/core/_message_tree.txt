The message tree is cached by the id of the current node, and expired if the number of messages in the
current list changes. The LRU strategy of the caching store means that memoization effectively occurs in
an efficient manner.  The infrequently accessed leaves of the store will expire from the caching store 
relatively quickly.

Since a mail archive typically only increases in size (and doesn't mutate existing messages); this is a
suitable caching strategy.

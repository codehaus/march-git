= Overview =
Within March, there are two pieces of information that are used together to determine what to display to the end 
users.

== the "root" ==
The root is determined from a query parameter "root" and determines the top of the displayed hierarchy.

This is typically used for large sites that display different parts of the tree to different VHosts.

While a VHost could determine which root to display, this presents a requirement for more configuration information
inside the application about which VHost corresponds to which root.  At present, this is too much effort to implement 
even though it would be trivial to implement.  The main downside for us is that we'd have to push additional
configuration information from Xircles across to March; and we don't care to.

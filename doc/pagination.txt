OFFSET Performance
------------------

The performance of PostgreSQL degrades as the OFFSET parameter increases.

This is problematic as it means that we can't generate arbitrary pages of data easily.

(as X messages are added, the page boundaries will shift)

"Solution"
----------

To cope with this, we will use a combination of user interface changes 
and precomputed indexes to find records of interest.

Given X records;
With N records per page.

The first page will have:

((X % N) + N) messages

After that, pages will have N message.

There will be  ((X - X % N) / N) pages in total.

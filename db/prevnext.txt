The process of calculating previous / next items is a convoluted one...

The following is true (and makes life easier (no indexes for next/prev))


1. A.next.prev == A (if A.next IS NOT NULL)
2. A.prev.next == A (if A.prev IS NOT NULL)


Solution
--------

Add two new fields to the MESSAGES table

message_id_next
message_id_previous

They will be filled in by a trigger on messages

INSERT
------
Imagine: A <-> B <-> D
Adding C

Look up C's previous => B

C.next => B.next
C.prev => B
B.next.prev (D.prev) => C
B.next => C


UPDATE
------
Same as INSERT + DELETE



DELETE
------
Imagine:   A <-> B <-> C
Removing B
B.prev.next (A.next) => B.next (C)
B.next.prev (C.prev) => B.prev (A)
